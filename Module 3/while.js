//a while loop evaluates the condition inside the paranthesis ()
//if the condition evaliuates to true, the code inside the while loop is executed
//the condition is evaluated again
//this process is repetsed untill the condition turns to false
//when the condition evaluates to false , the loop stops
//syntax

//while(condition){
    // code 
//}

//we have to print 1 to 10 using the while loop

var i =1
var n = 10

while(i<=10){
    console.log(i)
    i++
}

// do while loop- code runs once 

//var j = 5
var j = 11
var m = 10

do{
    console.log(j)
    j++
} while(j<=m)
